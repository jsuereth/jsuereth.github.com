title: Map-Reduce - Lessons Learned
category: scala
---

Yesterday I gave a talk to [PittJug](http://www.pghtech.org/networks/PittJug/Default.aspx) about Map-Reduce and a few patterns that are useful.  While I plan to update
the slides with additional drawings, better examples and removed typos, I thought perhaps those in attendance would appreciate being able to see them.

This talk is meant to provide very basic introduction to map-reduce and show the power of the abstraction through a few high-level patterns.  Hopefully it guides you to the important decisions you have to make when using map-reduce.
